                    <p> Note that if you got first place in the last round and you can't get rid of your cards first you automaticly get 0pts for the round</p>
                <h3>Trading cards</h3>
                    <p>this happens at the start of round 2 and 3 </p>  
                    <p>    Beggar(4th place) (must give away two of their highest-ranked cards) ↔ Tycoon(1st place) (must give away any two cards) Poor(3rd place)(must give away their highest-ranked card) ↔ Rich(2nd place)(must give away any one card)</p>
                <h4>How to get rid of cards</h4> 
                    <p> you can play cards in a single, pair, triple, and quaduple </p>
                    <p> you must play to beat the card currently on the table a single can only be beaten by a single a pair by a pair and so on</p>
                <h5>Card rankings and rules</h5>
                    <p> The cards rank standerd from 3-ace but 2 outranks ace and is the highest ranking</p>
                    <p>jokers can serve as wildcards and gan be substituted for any card in a set</p>
                    <P> if a joker is played as a single it is considerd the highest card</P>
                <h6>Revolution and Counterrevolution</h6>
                    <p>At the start of a trick If 4 cards of the same type(4 7s) is played all values are inverted</p>
                    <p>this makes 2 the lowist and 3 the highest</p>
                    <p>If a higher set of 4 cards is played during the turn this causes a Counterrevolution and the rankings retern to normal</p>
