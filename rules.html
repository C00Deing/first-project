                <h3>How to win</h3>
                    <p>Be the first player to play all of your cards</p>
                    <p>You can play any number of matching cards from 1-4</p>
                    <p>Each play must match the current number of cards, you must play two higher value matching cards to beat two matching cards, etc.</p>
                <h3>Card rankings and rules</h3>
                    <p>Values from Lowest to Highest: 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A 2 Joker</p>
                    <p>jokers can serve as wildcards and gan be substituted for any card in a set</p>
					<p>Additional rules are optional in the real game, but not implemented here.</p>
				<h3>Quirks</h3>
					<p>Due to limitations in animations, if you play cards and they don't appear, the other players likely skipped there turns.</p>
					<p>This means you get to lead again.</p>
					<p>You cannot see how many cards opponents have, sorry, not sorry.</p>
					<p>Also opponents take their turns instantly. Pay attention to what you play and what appears after.</p>
					<p>Thanks for reading :)</p>
